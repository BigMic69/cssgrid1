          <h2>CSS Grid (1st in DOM 3rd in order)</h2>
          <p>This will be my first attempt to use CSS Grid. I've already reviewed some of its documentation and video tutorials. I'm trying to limit my mind and just start with the basics, but I can already see the potential so its hard to control my eagerness.
          <br>
          <br>Also, this happens to be 1st in the DOM order for this 'Main' area that's colored green. I was able to use the nth-child order property to place it last. But I actually can't wait until I start using named areas.

        <div id="main-content-2">
          <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
          <p>I'm only going through the process of understanding how a basic grid with a few properties (or whatever they're called) work with each other.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="main-content-3">
          <h2>CSS Grid</h2>
          <p>Now I've only begun, but this already seems to have lightened up the mental load that comes with controlling ones grid structure. I guess we'll really know once we start making more complex grids that can be moved around as easy as graphic layers.
